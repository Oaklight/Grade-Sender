# Grade-Sender
Python3 script for grade sending

# Usage
```
python3 gradeSender.py
```
**send-grade.py is depreciated after the campus email smtp rule being strengthened.**
There will be an jupyter notebook version interactive interface.

Currently, it supports formatted .csv file. Next version will give a standard format description.
The system that I used has limitation on the sending frequency. Next version will make this adjustable.
